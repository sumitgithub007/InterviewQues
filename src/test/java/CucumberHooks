Cucumber provides the following hooks to run code at various points in the test execution lifecycle:

@Before – Runs before each scenario. Commonly used for setup like opening a browser.

@After – Runs after each scenario. Often used for teardown like closing the browser.

@BeforeStep – Runs before every step.

@AfterStep – Runs after every step.

@BeforeAll / @AfterAll – Runs once before/after all scenarios (only in Cucumber 7+ with @Suite).

#####Use the @After hook to take a screenshot when a scenario fails. Example in Java with Cucumber:


@After
public void tearDown(Scenario scenario) {
    if (scenario.isFailed()) {
        // Take screenshot
        byte[] screenshot = ((TakesScreenshot) driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.BYTES);
        scenario.attach(screenshot, "image/png", "Failed Screenshot");
    }
    driver.quit(); // Cleanup
}
